# Data Structures Implementations

This repository contains C++ implementations of various fundamental data structures. These were developed as part of **Istanbul Technical University BLG223E Data Structures** course assignments to gain hands-on experience with the inner workings and algorithms behind these structures.

## Implemented Data Structures

- **Array**: Implementation and manipulation of arrays.
- **Vector**: Dynamic array implementation with operations for resizing and element management.
- **Linked List**: Singly and doubly linked list implementations.
- **Doubly Skiplist**: A skiplist implementation with doubly linked nodes for efficient search, insert, and delete operations.
- **Quadruple Skiplist**: An advanced skiplist with multiple levels for optimized performance.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Implementation of a binary tree supporting efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.
- **Map**: Key-value pair storage with efficient lookups.
- **Hybrid Structures**: Experimental or combined data structure implementations.
- **File-based Solutions**: Solutions involving file I/O for processing data.
- **List Solutions**: Various list-based problem-solving approaches.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository was to deepen understanding of how these data structures function internally. Each implementation was coded from scratch, without relying on standard library features, to fully grasp their complexities and performance characteristics.
